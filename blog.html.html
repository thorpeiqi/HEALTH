            <h2>Cancer patients who don't respond to immunotherapy lack crucial immune cells</h2>
            <p>Boosting such cells may help more patients benefit from immunotherapy</p>

            <p>Summary: Cancer immunotherapy involves using activated T cells to destroy tumors, but it doesn't work for all patients. Researchers have discovered that a kind of dendritic cell is crucial for determining the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The discovery could lead to new ways to extend the benefits of immunotherapy to more patients.</p>

            <p>Summary: Multiple births, a short interval between pregnancies and mothers with a maternal physical or mental health condition are more at risk of having a low birth rate baby. Every year 20 million children are born with a birth weight below 2,500 grams, and considered low birthweight (LBW) babies The study looked to understand the risk factors for LBW so that resources and interventions could be scheduled effectively.</p>

            <p>Drug resistance to aminoglycosides, a class of antibiotics, may be driven more by exchanges between ecosystems than by drug consumption</p>

            <p>Summary: he spread of antibiotic resistance, where infectious bacteria are able to defeat the drugs intended to kill them, may not be primarily driven by antibiotic consumption, according to a new study.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Summary: Scientists provide additional evidence that intracranial pressure plays an important role in normal-tension glaucoma, which accounts for up to 50 per cent of all glaucoma cases. A recent clinical study demonstrates that low intracranial pressure correlates with impaired patient visibility, especially in the nasal zone.</p>
